        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>
        My First Introduction to Programming
        </h3>
        <p>
        I was first introduced to programming in my college Physics with Calculus class.
        I chose an assignment where I would explore Physics in Forensics,
        and ended up learning a few lines of Python code. This was enough to be able to use physics and calculus
        to create a simulation of a collision of three moving bodies. I used this to, in theory, determine
        who was at fault for an on-road auto collision. In order to solve this problem, I had a handful of variable data,
        of which included the vehicular bodies' final positions, points of contact,
        tire-tread visual evidence on the roadway, coeffcient of friction, proclaimed directions of travel
        and speeds of all bodies involved, as well as the speed limit of the region.
        Granted, this was a faux-collision, but I modeled a theoretical recreation, and I loved it!
        In that time, I was informally advised away from pursuing a CS degree.
        I explored other majors for a few years (Physics, Biology, Nutrition,
        Economics, Hospital Management, Accounting, Nursing, etc.),
        but never found anything that really felt like a good fit.
        I'm grateful that my life experiences have led me back to programming, albeit a decade later!
        </p>
        
        <h3>Goals for the Future</h3>
        <p>
        I am currently pursuing a transfer degree in Computer Science with
        Chemeketa Community College. I will be at Western Oregon University in Fall 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
        I am <em>finally</em> happy with where I am, and I am looking forward to my future!
        </p>
