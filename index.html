    <p>I believe in caring for our neighbors.</p>
    <p><em>brothers, sisters, daughters, cousins, aunts, uncles</em></p>
    <p>I believe in investing in a population that proves to have potential.</p>
    <p><em>college students</em></p>
    <p>I believe in adding strength to the over-all economy.</p>
    <p><em>this allows these loan borrowers to pour what income they have into the economy right now, 
        instead of waiting a decade later</em></p>
    <p>Covid has greatly impacted the quality of life and financial state of our economy 
        and the independent financial state of many Americans.</p>
    <p>A college educated population is supposed to strengthen the economy, 
        because their earning potential permits a higher sum of money to be pumped back into the economy.</p>
    <p>This money is historically expected to be spent locally 
        and invested into mom and pop stores, or other businesses that create jobs, 
        as well as spent on things in excess of basic needs.</p>
    <p>However, due to Covid causing a huge increase in cost of living, 
        these loan borrowers are spending more and more to pay off their debts and cost of living, 
        thus are not investing this money back into the economy.</p>
    <p>Instead, their money is all going to a few “banks”. 
        When all the money is poured into the pockets of a few 
        (especially when such pockets do not create jobs), this hurts the over all economy.</p>
    <p>The alternative is a major slow down in the amount of money 
        that these college graduates are spending outside of debt repayment, 
        for a much longer amount of time.</p>
    <p>Without the relief, these Americans are essentially excluded from 
        participating in the economy as a whole.</p>
    <p>With relief, all Americans donate just a little bit of money to save the 
        economy from a recession type of situation.</p>
    <p>Without the relief, future American could choose to avoid college 
        altogether which would likely cause a depression in years to come.</p>
    <p>Taxation exists to provide a more stable economy. This aid relief is exactly within 
        the lines of creating a more stable future. Without stability, a nation will collapse.</p>
    <p>Try to think beyond the knee jerk reaction taxation might have on you.</p>
    <p>This is BEYOND whether you think these people deserve your support or not.</p>
    <p>But, on that note, allow me to rant.</p>
    <p>Try to have some empathy, put yourself in other peoples' shoes, 
        and think beyond the knee jerk reactions you have when considering taxation.</p>
    <p>The Americans who are financially suffering the most are the college 
        students with mountains of loans, as these Americans are not home owners and therefore do not have equity.</p>
    <p>Covid made this homeownerships pursuit even more impossible for this group of Americans due to the 
        record high price in the housing market.</p>
    <p>These students are the peers, sons and daughters.</p>
    <p>Everybody in America deserves an equal chance to thrive. </p>
    <p>College set a large portion of this generation back, opposed to the what they were “promised".</p>
    <p>College students; people who are worthy of some support deserve this chance.</p>
    <p>These are the engineers who survey the roads you drive on every day.</p>
    <p>These are the engineers who make sure that the stop lights in town are operating safely.</p>
    <p>These are the food scientists who are making sure that the food you buy from the store is safe to eat.</p>
    <p>These are the food inspectors who are making sure that the 
        restaurants that you eat at are sanitary and up to standards.</p>
    <p>These are the teachers who teach your children at school.</p>
    <p>These are the dental hygienists who clean your teeth and help your teeth from falling out.</p>
    <p>These are the Nurses who help you when you  visit the Doctors office or Hospital.</p>
    <p>These people went to college to serve the public; 
        they are working behind the scenes to make America a safe country to live in.</p>
    <p>These people deserve American support, regardless of whether doing so will save the country from a depression.</p>
