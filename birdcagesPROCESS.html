                Birds are exotic pets. Like reptiles, they are delicate; 
                they require a perfect set of environmental 
                conditions in order to sustain life.

                    Problems I faced with the Traditional Cage Style
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Poor air quality can cause significant respiratory distress to birds, which can be life threatening. 
                    While barred cages offer optimal ventilation, this can expose birds to drafts. 
                    Since my apartment is small, it gets stuffy quickly. I need to ventilate it often, which means my birds are exposed to drafts. 
                    Drafts and sudden changes in temperatures from windows can induce significant stress to the avian species, 
                    and periods of stress can be life threatening to them. 
                    
                    <br><br>

                    <em>conures beak in cage</em>
                    <br>
                    Barred cages also don't offer much of a physical barrier, as toes and beaks can fit through the spaces between the bars. 
                    
                    <br><br>

                    <em>babies in recovery</em>
                    <br>
                    A few of my smaller birds lost toes on multiple occasions from one of my more aggressive species, despite them being separated by the bars. 
                    
                    <br><br>

                    My birds need daily exercise, so I needed a way to for my uncaged birds to be protected from the caged birds, and vice versa.
                    I tried other temporary solutions, but they still imposed a risk to the birds. 
                    
                    <br><br>

                    <em>barred cages wrapped with fleece draped around</em>
                    <br>
                    I tried covering the cages with fabric, but I was faced with a shredding issue, which is a danger to the birds. 

                    <br><br>

                    I thought to cover with a plastic covering, or low-shred fleece, but this route had ventilation issue of which I could not design around. 
                    
                    
                    <br><br>

                    An acrylic enclosure would grant all the necessary protections I was looking for on behalf of my birds' safety. 
                    But, acrylic cages are very expensive; approximately 6 times the cost of barred cages per square foot of enclosed space.

                </p>

                    Here is an image of the design drawings:

                <p>
                    <b>Dimension Requirements:</b>
                    <br>
                    Budgie: 24' x 24'
                    <br>
                    Cockatiel: 24' x 18'
                    <br>
                    Quaker: 24' x 24'
                    <br>
                    Conure: 20' x 20'
                </p>

                Ideally, I would have chosen the largest minimum requirement, and applied it for each one of my five birds' cage.
                <br>

                    
                Meaning, these would have all been 24' by 24'. 
                But, I had to modify the dimension to 22' by 24' in order for them to fit on top of the tables they sit on.
                Ideally, each individual cage would sit atop individual caster rolling-stands designed by me.
                But, that still remains to be outside of my current budget.

                    I sourced my acrylic sheets from my local
                    <a href="https://www.tapplastics.com/about/locations/detail/tigard_or">TAP Plastics</a>.

                    <br>
                    They were able to supply me with custom size sheets,
                    of which I chose 22' by 24'.

                    <br>
                    They were able to router out the square hole for my door assembly.

                    <em>image: special drill bit</em>
                    <br>
                    I got this special drill bit to drill holes in the acrylic sheets
                    for the bracket assembly, as well as the holes for mounting items in the enclosures.
                    <br>
                    This style of bit reduces fractures in the acrylic.

                    <br>
                    I got assistance with printing the brackets.
                    This 3-D printer belongs to Stephen.
                    He loaded the filament and processed the printing.
                    He used <a href="https://www.freecad.org/">FreeCAD</a>Software.
                    He showed me the process it took to translate my bracket design into a CAD drawing 
                    so that it could be read as a set of instructions by the 3-D printer.
                    Once the print was complete, I got to clean the prints 
                    (remove excess stabilizing filament).

                    My husband was <em>finally</em> seeing the design once it came
                    to life and became excited by that.
                    I had plans for the door latch and hinge.
                    But, Stephen ended up proposing his own designs. It was my pleasure to let them be implemented, as
                    I was trhilled that he finally became excited about the enclosures.
                    His design is implemented here.

                    <em>image: egg crate ceiling</em>
                    For the ceiling, I used eggcrate,
                    as it was available at my local <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Plaskolite-4-ft-x-2-ft-Suspended-Egg-Crate-Light-Ceiling-Panel-1199233A/202025149">Home Depot</a>,
                    is sturdy, offers adequate ventilation,
                    continues to permit my birds to hang upside down, and has a
                    thickness which offers a safe physical barrier from curious toes and beaks.

                    I sourced some branches for free where I knew pesticides were not sprayed.
                    I washed them with soap and water, then baked them in the oven at
                    165 degrees Farenheight for one hour to serve as an autoclave and
                    disinfect the wood.
