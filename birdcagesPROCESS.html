                Birds are exotic pets. Like reptiles, they are delicate; 
                they require a perfect set of environmental 
                conditions in order to sustain life.

                    Problems I faced with the Traditional Cage Style
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <img class="medium" src="/birds/traditional.jpg" alt="Lemon and BB in traditional barred cage">

                    <br>

                    Poor air quality can cause significant respiratory distress to birds, which can be life threatening. 
                    While barred cages offer optimal ventilation, this can expose birds to drafts. 
                    Since my apartment is small, it gets stuffy quickly. I need to ventilate it often, which means my birds are exposed to drafts. 
                    Drafts and sudden changes in temperatures from windows can induce significant stress to the avian species, 
                    and periods of stress can be life threatening to them. 
                    
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Barred cages don't offer much of a physical barrier, as toes and beaks can fit through the spaces between the bars. 
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="small" src="/birds/connorbeak.jpg" alt="connor's beak through bars">

                    <img class="small" src="/birds/connorsleeping.jpg" alt="and yet another image of connor's beak through bars">


                    <br>
                    A few of my smaller birds lost toes on multiple occasions from the beak of one of my more aggressive species, despite them being separated by the bars. 
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="small" src="/birds/bbtoes.jpg" alt="BB's toes">
                    
                    <br>

                    My birds need daily exercise, so I needed a way to for my uncaged birds to be protected from the caged birds, and vice versa.
                    I tried other temporary solutions, but they still imposed a risk to the birds. 
                    
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    I tried covering the cages with fabric, but I was faced with a shredding issue, which is a danger to the birds. 

                    <br><br>

                    <img class="medium" src="/birds/connorhanging.jpg" alt="connor hanging around fabric enclosed cages">

                    <br>

                    I thought to cover with a plastic covering or a low-shred fleece, but this route had ventilation issues of which I could not design around. 
                    
                    
                    <br><br>

                    An acrylic enclosure would grant all the necessary protections I was looking for on behalf of my birds' safety. 
                    <br>
                    But, acrylic cages are very expensive; 
                    <br>  
                    approximately 6 times the cost of barred cages per square foot 
                    <br>
                    of enclosed space if purchased ready-to-use or out-of-the-box.

                <p>
                    <b>Requirements:</b>
                    <br>
                    1. Adequate ventilation
                    <br>
                    2. Easily cleanable
                    <br>
                    3. Desirable for the birds
                    <br>
                    4. Protection barrier from penatrable 
                    <br>  
                    objects and drafts (walls and ceiling)        
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Dimension Requirements:</b>
                    <br>
                    Budgie: 24' x 24'
                    <br>
                    Cockatiel: 24' x 18'
                    <br>
                    Quaker: 24' x 24'
                    <br>
                    Conure: 20' x 20'
                </p>

                Ideally, I would have chosen the largest minimum requirement, and applied it for each one of my five birds' cage.
                    
                Meaning, these would have all been 24' by 24'. 
                But, I had to modify the dimension to 22' by 24' in order for them to fit on top of the tables they currently sit on.
                I'd like for each individual cage to sit atop individual caster rolling-stands designed by me.
                But, that still remains to be outside of my current budget.

                    I sourced my acrylic sheets from my local

                    They were able to supply me with custom size sheets,
                    of which I chose 22' by 24'.

                    They were able to router out the square hole for my door assembly.

                    <br>
                    I got this special drill bit to drill holes in the acrylic sheets
                    for the bracket assembly, as well as the holes for mounting items in the enclosures.
                    <br>
                    I had originally used the traditional cylindrical drill bits which are specifically made for wood. 
                    This was working fine for the smaller holes for the door assembly. But, 
                    when I sized up for creating holes for mounting the brackets, perches and food dishes,
                    the bit was chipping and cracking the acrylic.
                    <br>
                    This style of bit reduces fractures in the acrylic.

                    I got assistance with printing the brackets.
                    This 3-D printer belongs to Stephen.
                    He loaded the filament and processed the printing.
                    He used <a href="https://www.freecad.org/">FreeCAD</a>Software.
                    He showed me the process it took to translate my bracket design into a CAD drawing 
                    so that it could be read as a set of instructions by the 3-D printer.
                    Once the print was complete, I got to clean the prints 
                    (remove excess stabilizing filament).

                    My husband was <em>finally</em> seeing the design once it came
                    to life and became excited by that.
                    I had plans for the door latch and hinge.
                    But, Stephen ended up proposing his own designs. It was my pleasure to let them be implemented, as
                    I was trhilled that he finally became excited about the enclosures.
                    His design is implemented here.

                    165 degrees Farenheight for one hour to serve as an autoclave and
                    disinfect the wood.
