                Birds are exotic pets. Like reptiles, they are delicate; 
                they require a perfect set of environmental 
                conditions in order to sustain life.

                    Problems I faced with the Traditional Cage Style
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <img class="medium" src="/birds/traditional.jpg" alt="Lemon and BB in traditional barred cage">

                    <br>

                    Poor air quality can cause significant respiratory distress to birds, which can be life threatening. 
                    While barred cages offer optimal ventilation, this can expose birds to drafts. 
                    Since my apartment is small, it gets stuffy quickly. I need to ventilate it often, which means my birds are exposed to drafts. 
                    Drafts and sudden changes in temperatures from windows can induce significant stress to the avian species, 
                    and periods of stress can be life threatening to them. 
                    
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Barred cages just don't offer much of a physical barrier. 
                    Not from air particles, or larger objects, particularly toes and beaks can fit through the spaces between the bars. 
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="small" src="/birds/connorbeak.jpg" alt="connor's beak through bars">

                    <br>
                    A few of my smaller birds lost toes on multiple occasions from the beak of one of my more aggressive species, despite them being separated by the bars. 
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="small" src="/birds/bbtoes.jpg" alt="BB's toes">
                    
                    <br>

                    My birds need daily exercise, so I needed a way to for my uncaged birds to be protected from the caged birds, and vice versa.
                    I tried other temporary solutions, but they still imposed a risk to the birds. 
                    
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    I tried covering the cages with fabric, but I was faced with a shredding issue, which is a danger to the birds. 

                    <br><br>

                    <img class="medium" src="/birds/connorhanging.jpg" alt="connor hanging around fabric enclosed cages">

                    <br>

                    I thought to cover with a plastic covering or a low-shred fleece, but this route had ventilation issues of which I could not design around. 
                    
                    
                    <br><br>

                    An acrylic enclosure would grant all the necessary protections I was looking for on behalf of my birds' safety. 
                    <br>
                    But, acrylic cages are very expensive; 
                    <br>
                    approximately 6 times the cost of barred cages per square foot 
                    <br>
                    of enclosed space if purchased ready-to-use or out-of-the-box.

                <p>
                    <b>Requirements:</b>
                    <br>
                    1. Adequate ventilation
                    <br>
                    2. Easily cleanable
                    <br>
                    3. Desirable for the birds
                    <br>
                    4. Protection barrier from penatrable 
                    <br>  
                    objects and drafts (walls and ceiling)        
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Dimension Requirements:</b>
                    <br>
                    Budgie: 24' x 24'
                    <br>
                    Cockatiel: 24' x 18'
                    <br>
                    Quaker: 24' x 24'
                    <br>
                    Conure: 20' x 20'
                </p>

                Ideally, I would have chosen the largest minimum requirement, and applied it for each one of my five birds' cage.
                    
                Meaning, these would have all been 24' by 24'. 
                But, I had to modify the dimension to 22' by 24' in order for them to fit on top of the tables they currently sit on.
                I'd like for each individual cage to sit atop individual caster rolling-stands designed by me.
                But, that still remains to be outside of my current budget.

                <p>
                    I sourced my acrylic sheets from my local
                    <a href="https://www.tapplastics.com/about/locations/detail/tigard_or">TAP Plastics</a>.

                    <br><br>

                    They were able to supply me with custom size sheets,
                    of which I chose 22' by 24'.

                    
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Tap Plastics was able to router out the square hole for my door assembly.
                    <br>
                    The edges were sharp, so I used a butane torch to smooth and shine the edges.
                    
                    <br><br>


                    <img class="small" src="/production/acrylicbit.png" alt="acrylicdrillbit">
                    <br>
                    I got this special drill bit to drill holes in the acrylic sheets
                    for the bracket assembly, as well as the holes for mounting items in the enclosures.
                    <br>
                    I had originally used the traditional cylindrical drill bits which are specifically made for wood. 
                    <br>
                    This was working fine for the smaller holes for the door assembly. 

                    <br>
                    But, when I sized up for creating holes for mounting the brackets, 
                    perches and food dishes,
                    the bit was chipping and cracking the acrylic.
                    <br><br>

                    <br>
                    I used a butane torch to heat the fractured hole post-drill in my 
                    best effort to prevent the stress fractures from spreading over time and use.
                    <br><br>

                    This style of bit reduces fractures in the acrylic.

                    <br>
                    I used a butane torch to heat the holes post-drill to seal any minor chipping.
   

                    <br>


                    <br>
                    I got assistance with printing the brackets.
                    The 3-D printer used for my project belongs to Stephen.
                    He loaded the filament and processed the printing.
                    He used <a href="https://www.freecad.org/">FreeCAD </a>Software.
                    He showed me the process it took to translate my bracket design into a CAD drawing 
                    so that it could be read as a set of instructions by the 3-D printer.
                    Once the print was complete, I got to clean the prints 
                    (remove excess stabilizing filament).

                    <br>
                    I used this heating element to inset the hardware to 3-D printed brackets.
                    <br>
                    I used the larger tip for insetting the hardware into the brackets.
                    <br>
                    I used the smaller tip for insetting the hardware into the hoor handle and door hinge 3D prints.

                        My husband was <em>finally</em> seeing the design once it came
                        to life and became excited by that.
                        I had plans for the door latch and hinge.
                        But, Stephen ended up proposing his own designs. It was my pleasure to let them be implemented, as
                        I was trhilled that he finally became excited about the enclosures.
                        Plus, I thought his idea was more creative and beautiful. 
                        All I asked of his design was that it be scaled down to a smaller size that I would be comfortable handling each day.
                        His designs (with my size input) is implemented here.

                        thickness which offers a safe physical barrier from curious toes and beaks.
